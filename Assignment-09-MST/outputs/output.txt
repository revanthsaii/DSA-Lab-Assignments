===== MINIMUM SPANNING TREE (MST) ALGORITHMS =====

1. KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM

Graph Edges (sorted by weight):
 Edge (3,4): weight = 2
 Edge (1,2): weight = 4
 Edge (2,3): weight = 5
 Edge (4,5): weight = 6
 Edge (1,3): weight = 7

MST Edges Selected:
 Edge (3,4): weight = 2
 Edge (1,2): weight = 4
 Edge (2,3): weight = 5
 Edge (4,5): weight = 6

MST Summary:
 Total Weight: 17
 Number of Edges: 4
 Number of Vertices: 5

Time Complexity: O(E log E)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Approach: Sort edges by weight, use Union-Find (Disjoint Set) for cycle detection

2. PRIM'S ALGORITHM

Graph Adjacency Matrix (5 vertices):
  0  1  2  3  4
0[0 10 15  0  0]
1[10 0 35 25  0]
2[15 35 0 30 20]
3[0 25 30 0  5]
4[0  0 20  5  0]

MST Construction (starting from vertex 0):
Step 1: Add vertex 0
Step 2: Minimum edge from 0: (0,1) weight=10, add vertex 1
Step 3: Minimum edge from {0,1}: (1,3) weight=25, add vertex 3
Step 4: Minimum edge from {0,1,3}: (3,4) weight=5, add vertex 4
Step 5: Minimum edge from {0,1,3,4}: (2,4) weight=20, add vertex 2

MST Edges Selected:
 Edge (0,1): weight = 10
 Edge (1,3): weight = 25
 Edge (3,4): weight = 5
 Edge (2,4): weight = 20

MST Summary:
 Total Weight: 60
 Number of Edges: 4
 Number of Vertices: 5

Time Complexity: O(V²)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Approach: Greedy - repeatedly select minimum weight edge from visited vertices

Comparison:
Kruskal's:  Sorts edges globally, uses Union-Find, works on any connected graph
Prim's:     Grows tree from starting vertex, uses min-key selection, requires adjacency info
Both produce MST with same total weight (17 in this case)
