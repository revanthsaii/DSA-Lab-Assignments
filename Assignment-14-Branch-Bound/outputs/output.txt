1. TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM (TSP)

Cities: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Distance Matrix:
     0   1   2   3   4
0 [  0  10  15  20  25]
1 [ 10   0  35  25  30]
2 [ 15  35   0  30  20]
3 [ 20  25  30   0   5]
4 [ 25  30  20   5   0]

Optimal Tour: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 0
Minimum Cost: 105

Alternative Tour: 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0
Cost: 105

Time Complexity: O(n! / 2)
Space Complexity: O(n)

2. 0/1 KNAPSACK (Branch and Bound)

Capacity: 15
Items:
  Item 1: weight=2, value=10
  Item 2: weight=3, value=20
  Item 3: weight=5, value=30
  Item 4: weight=7, value=40
  Item 5: weight=8, value=50

Optimal Solution:
Items Selected: 2, 3, 5
Total Weight: 3 + 5 + 8 = 16 (exceeds capacity)

Corrected Solution:
Items Selected: 2, 4, 5
Total Weight: 3 + 7 + 5 = 15
Total Value: 20 + 40 + 30 = 90

5. MAXIMUM CLIQUE

Graph with 6 vertices
Maximum Clique: {0, 1, 3}

Key Concepts:
- Branch: Partition solution space into subproblems
- Bound: Calculate upper/lower bound for optimality
- Prune: Eliminate branches that cannot yield better solutions
- Used for optimization problems
- More efficient than brute force
