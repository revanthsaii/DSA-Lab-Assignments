===== PATTERN MATCHING ALGORITHMS =====

1. KMP (KNUTH-MORRIS-PRATT) ALGORITHM

Text: "ABABDABABACABAB"
Pattern: "ABABCABAB"

LPS (Longest Proper Prefix which is also Suffix) Array:
Pattern: A B A B C A B A B
LPS:    [0 0 1 2 0 1 2 3 4]

Matches found at positions:
No match found

Text: "ABABDABABACABAB"
Pattern: "ABABDAB"

Matches found at positions:
Position 0

Time Complexity: O(n + m)
Space Complexity: O(m)
where n = length of text, m = length of pattern

---

2. BOYER-MOORE ALGORITHM

Text: "ABCCDDAEFGGHII"
Pattern: "GGH"

Bad Character Table:
G: 2
H: 1
Others: 3

Matches found at positions:
Position 9
Total matches: 1

Time Complexity: O(n/m) best case, O(nm) worst case
Space Complexity: O(k) where k = alphabet size

3. RABIN-KARP ALGORITHM

Text: "ABCCDDAEFGGHII"
Pattern: "GGH"
Prime: 101
Base: 256

Hash of pattern: 72
Matches found at positions:
Position 9
Total matches: 1

Time Complexity: O(n + m) average case
Space Complexity: O(1)

---

4. Z-ALGORITHM

Text: "aabxaabxaaab"
Z-array: [12, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0]

Pattern: "aab"
Matches found at positions:
Position 0
Position 4
Position 7
Total matches: 3

Time Complexity: O(n + m)
Space Complexity: O(n + m)

---

5. AKHО-CORASICK ALGORITHM

Multiple Pattern Matching:
Text: "ushers"
Patterns: ["she", "he", "her", "hers"]

Patterns found:
Pattern "she" at position 1
Pattern "he" at position 2
Pattern "her" at position 2
Pattern "hers" at position 2

Time Complexity: O(n + sum(m) + z)
where z = total matches
Space Complexity: O(sum(m) * k)
where k = alphabet size

---

6. SUFFIX ARRAY APPROACH

Text: "banana"
Suffix Array: [5, 3, 1, 0, 4, 2]
Corresponding Suffixes:
  Index 5: "a"
  Index 3: "ana"
  Index 1: "anana"
  Index 0: "banana"
  Index 4: "na"
  Index 2: "nana"

Pattern: "ana"
Matches found at positions: 1, 3

Time Complexity: O((n + m) log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Algorithm        | Time Complexity | Space  | Best Case
KMP              | O(n + m)        | O(m)   | Single pattern
Boyer-Moore      | O(n/m)          | O(k)   | Long patterns
Rabin-Karp       | O(n + m)        | O(1)   | Rolling hash
Z-Algorithm      | O(n + m)        | O(n)   | Linear
Aho-Corasick     | O(n + sum(m))   | O(k)   | Multiple patterns
Suffix Array     | O(n log n)      | O(n)   | Preprocessing
