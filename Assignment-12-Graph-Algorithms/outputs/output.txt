===== GRAPH ALGORITHMS =====

1. BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS)

Graph:
  0 -- 1 -- 3
  |         |
  2 ------- 4

Adjacency List:
0: [1, 2]
1: [0, 3]
2: [0, 4]
3: [1, 4]
4: [2, 3]

BFS from Source 0:
Visit Order: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
Distance from 0:
  0: 0
  1: 1
  2: 1
  3: 2
  4: 2

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V)

2. DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS)

DFS from Source 0 (Recursive):
Visit Order: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2

DFS from Source 0 (Iterative - Stack):
Visit Order: 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Approach: Recursion or Stack-based iteration

---

3. TOPOLOGICAL SORT (DAG)

Directed Acyclic Graph:
5 -> 2 -> 3
4 -> 2
4 -> 1
5 -> 0
1 -> 3

Topological Order: 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> 3

Alternative Order: 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0

Using Kahn's Algorithm (BFS):
Indegree: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0}
Order: 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> 3

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V)

4. CONNECTED COMPONENTS

Undirected Graph:
Component 1: 0-1-3-4-2
Component 2: 5-6
Component 3: 7

DFS-based Connected Components:
Component 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Component 2: [5, 6]
Component 3: [7]

Total Components: 3
Largest Component: 0 (size 5)

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V)

---

5. BIPARTITE CHECK

Graph:
Set A: {0, 2}
Set B: {1, 3}

Edges: 0-1, 0-3, 2-1, 2-3
Is Bipartite: Yes
Coloring: 0->Red, 1->Blue, 2->Red, 3->Blue

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Approach: 2-coloring using BFS/DFS

---

Summary:
- BFS: Level-order traversal, shortest path in unweighted graphs
- DFS: Recursive/Stack-based, useful for topological sorting
- Topological Sort: For DAGs, represents dependency order
- Connected Components: Grouping of connected vertices
- Bipartite: Graph coloring with 2 colors
