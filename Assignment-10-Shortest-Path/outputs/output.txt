===== DIJKSTRA'S SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM =====

Graph Setup:
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Edges with weights:
0 -> 1 (4)
0 -> 2 (2)
1 -> 2 (1)
1 -> 3 (5)
2 -> 3 (8)
2 -> 4 (10)
3 -> 4 (2)
4 -> 3 (1)

Shortest Paths from Source Vertex 0:
Vertex 0: Distance = 0, Path = 0
Vertex 1: Distance = 3, Path = 0 -> 2 -> 1
Vertex 2: Distance = 2, Path = 0 -> 2
Vertex 3: Distance = 10, Path = 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3
Vertex 4: Distance = 12, Path = 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4

Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V)
Space Complexity: O(V)

Algorithm Details:
Visited Vertices: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
Total Edges Relaxed: 9
